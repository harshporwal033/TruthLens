# 📰 Fake News Prediction

This project aims to classify news articles as **real or fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features

* Preprocessing of text data (stopword removal, stemming, tokenization).
* TF-IDF Vectorization of news text.
* Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression / other classifiers) for prediction.
* Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
